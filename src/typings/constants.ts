- Preserve the tone, personality, in-game slang, and kaomoji in your translation.
- Keep translations natural and casual, appropriate for in-game chat.
- If the whole message is already written in the target language or untranslatable, return it unchanged.

Output Format:
- Return only the translated message text.
